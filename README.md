# sumo

## Build status

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/reiddraper/sumo.png)](http://travis-ci.org/reiddraper/sumo)

## Dependencies

```
lein deps
```

To use sumo with another project, add `[sumo "0.0.1-SNAPSHOT"]` to your `projects.clj`.

## Usage
```clojure
(require '[sumo.client :as sumo]
         '[clojure.pprint :as pp])

(def client (sumo/connect))

(sumo/ping client)
;; => true

(sumo/put client "bucket" "key" {:value "hello, sumo!"})
;; => nil

;; sumo will default to "application/json" content-type and serialization
;; you can override this by setting it in the object hash-map
(sumo/put client "bucket" "key" {:content-type "text/plain"
                                 :value "hello, sumo!"})
;; => nil


;; returns a lazy-seq of hash-maps
(pp/pprint (sumo/get client "bucket" "key"))
;; => ({:value "hello, sumo!",
;;      :metadata {},
;;      :last-modified #<Date Sun Dec 18 20:40:03 CST 2011>,
;;      :vtag "6YWpgJW8WpnKlNTOeOxKZf",
;;      :content-type "application/json",
;;      :vector-clock
;;      #<BasicVClock com.basho.riak.client.cap.BasicVClock@50aec4>})

;; you can also pass an options hash-map into requests
;; for example, to use an R value of 2 and only return the object metadata
(sumo/get client "bucket" "key" {:r 2 :head true}))

;; or to use a W value of 3 and return a lazy-seq of hash-maps just like sumo/get
(sumo/put client "bucket" "key" {:value "hey there"}
                                {:w 3 :return-body true})

;; you can store secondary indexes by adding an :indexes hash-map containing
;; keywords as keys and sets as values to your object
(sumo/put client "bucket" "key" {:value {:name "John" :email "john@example.com"}
                                 :indexes {:email #{"john@example.com"}})

;; querying secondary indexes is supported as well
(sumo/index-query client "bucket" :email "john@example.com")
; search for a range
(sumo/index-query client "bucket" :email "i" "k")

; or an integer
(sumo/index-query client "bucket" :age [21 80])
```

## Roadmap

sumo currently just supports basic key/value access. The following is a TODO list of sorts
along with some ideas for a higher level interface.

### TODO

* multi-client connections
* http connections (sumo is currently just protocol buffers)
* 2i queries
* mapreduce
* links
* search

### Higher-level interface ideas

These are just some ideas we've been playing
around with for how the high-level API might look:

Apply a series of forms to whatever
value is currently stored at `bucket`, `key`:

```clojure
;; Apply a form to the
;; current value at `key`,
;; and resave. Similar to Mutations
;; in the Java client
(send-riak "bucket" "key"
  ;; your form will be called
  ;; threading in the obj
  ;; as the second value,
  ;; much like (-> obj (..) (..))
  (assoc-in [:value] inc))
```

The next idea is an ODM of sorts that supports
automatic conflict-resolution of your domain objects
but letting you construct them from [knockbox](http://github.com/reiddraper/knockbox)
data types.

```clojure
(defbox Account
  ;; the second item in the
  ;; list is a type or protocol
  ;; to restrict the value to
  (:name       LWWRegister :required true)
  (:address    LWWRegister :required true)
  ;; specify a default value for this field,
  ;; in this case, the result of calling the
  ;; function `lww-set`
  (:followers  ObservedRemoveSet :default (lww-set)))

(def person (Account.))

(-> person
  ;; add :bar to the followers list
  (update-in [:followers] conj :bar)
  ;; set the name
  (assoc-in  [:name]      "Reid")
  ;; set the address
  (assoc-in  [:address]   "27 Lexington Ave"))
```
